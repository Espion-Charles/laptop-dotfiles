So, this project is my laptop config files.

Project in construction, not much to see ig.

If for some odd reason you want to install it, just git clone it, then use chmod +x ~/laptop-dotfiles/install.sh and then run ~/laptop-dotfiles/install.sh

You want to be on a clean install to install it, I don't want to bother trying to make things work on a preexisting one.
